For the twitch-gamer dataset we will be using, we are going to use a B-Tree data structure for to represent the data.

- Node = individuals stream
- std::vector<T> streamer_information: 1. views
                                       2. mature
                                       3. life_time
                                       4. created_at
                                       5. updated_at
                                       6. numeric_id
                                       7. dead_account  
                                       8. language  
                                       9. affiliate    

- std::vector<Node> streamer_relations: In the dataset, the edges coming from each streamer point to a streamer id that represents  another streamer. They represent individual follower relationships between them. This means that the current streamer's followers follow the other streamer.
