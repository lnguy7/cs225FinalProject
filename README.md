GitHub Organization

Code:
    All code used to compile the final project can be found in the src directory.
    CSV files used for the final project and for testing, and CMakeLists can be found in the lib directory.
    The code for main is in the entry directory.
    Build contains the CMakeFiles for whoever is compiling the final project. Deleting and recreating the build directory may be required.
    When compiling the code using the terminal command make, compilation may freeze around 20%. Should this happen, ctrl+z to exit the file, then attempt to make again. This worked consistently to deal with a problem that happened consistently during the development process.

Tests:
    Test cases can be found in the tests directory, in the file tests.cpp. Contained are multiple test cases for multiple basic aspects of the project.

Data:
    The input data used for the final project can be seen within files containing "large_twitch" in the lib directory. Output data is collected within main and can be found after running at (location)

Written Report:
    The written report is named report.md and can be found at (location)
