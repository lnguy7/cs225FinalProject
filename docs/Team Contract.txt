# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 
We plan to meet every Sunday for about 2 hours. We will usually meet in person so we won't need any online calling feature to do so. We will all take notes and keep track of important information. Every week, the group will revaluate the meeting time on Sunday for the following week, as well as the frequency of group meetings depending on how much work needs to get done.

2. **Assistance** 
We have an online groupchat in Discord which we can send messages in to ask for help. We will be expected to respond within an hour when people ask or request for help. If needed, we can call the other person on Discord and look over their code and their thought processes.

3. **Respect** 
When someone has something to bring to the table, we will make sure to not talk over them so that we can all hear and listen to them. We will all be open to new ideas and can discuss our different opinions while also taking into account the other members. In addition, members are expected to be patient and courteous when solving problems in the project, like if the timeline is not going to plan. 

## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 
Each week we will attempt to distribute work accordingly to the each persons' availability. This will address unexpected complications as each person will be able to set their availiability accordingly. We know each other well enough to ensure each person is doing what they feel comfortable with along with having enough work to do. Overall we expect each person's work to be equal in rigor and quantity, however, due to extraneous and unforeseen circumstances.


5. **Time Commitment** 
We plan to meet up for about 2 hours each week together (more if necessary), and separately, we will spend 3-6 hours working on our individual parts outside of the weekly meetings. All of us have busy schedules and prior time commitments, so we will try to keep the time spent as low as possible while still getting all of the necessary work done.

6. **Conflict Resolution** 
When there is a disagreement among members, then the point in question will be voted upon by all members of the group. If work is not getting done, then the group will revaluate the dispersal of work, as well as identify the root of the problem (whether that is a lack of time, or understanding of the project). Members should be punctual to within ten minutes of the agreed upon meeting time. Most members are willing to stay longer if there is work to get done; however, if a member a perpetually late (more than 2 times), then there will be an intervention.
